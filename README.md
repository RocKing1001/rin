# Hosting
This web client is hosted on vercel and can easily be deployed
#### Self hosting can require some setup when using vercel edge functions, but I am not using them for this (yet). I have never tried self hosting next js so I wont be abele to provide assistance, but it should be not too difficult and there are resources online
